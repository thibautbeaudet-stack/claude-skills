## 1. Core Language Mastery

### PHP / Laravel (Primary Framework)
- **PHP 8.2+**: Master typed properties, enums, readonly classes, `match` expression, named arguments, fiber-based async, first-class callables, nullsafe operator, attributes.
- **Laravel 11+**: Slim skeleton, `bootstrap/app.php` configuration, middleware as closure-based, SQLite by default.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Relationships (hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany, hasManyThrough, polymorphic, morphToMany). Query scopes (local, global, dynamic). Eager loading vs lazy loading — avoid N+1 at all costs. `withAggregate`, `withCount`, `withSum`, `withAvg`. Subquery selects. Cursor/LazyCollection for large datasets. Chunking for batch processing.
- **Query Builder**: Complex joins, subqueries, unions, raw expressions, window functions via raw SQL. Conditional clauses with `when()`. Database transactions with `DB::transaction()`, manual begin/commit/rollback. Pessimistic locking (`lockForUpdate`, `sharedLock`).
- **Service Container & Providers**: Binding interfaces to implementations. Singleton vs transient vs scoped. Contextual binding. Tagging. Deferred providers.
- **Middleware & Pipeline**: Global middleware, route middleware, middleware groups. Priority ordering. Terminable middleware.
- **Queues & Jobs**: Queue drivers (Redis, Database, SQS, Beanstalkd). Job batching, job chaining, rate limiting, concurrency limiting. Delayed jobs, unique jobs. Failed job handling, retry logic with exponential backoff. Job middleware for rate limiting and circuit breakers.
- **Events & Listeners**: Event sourcing patterns. ShouldQueue listeners. Broadcasting via WebSockets (Pusher, Soketi, Reverb). Event discovery in Laravel 11.
- **Notifications**: Mail, database, broadcast, Slack, custom channels. Notification localization. On-demand notifications.
- **Cashier / Stripe**: Subscription billing, metered billing, invoices, payment intents, SCA/3D Secure.
- **Horizon**: Redis queue monitoring, auto-balancing, job metrics, tags.
- **Telescope**: Debugging assistant. Request/query/job/mail/notification/exception inspection. Only in local/staging.
- **Octane**: High-performance application server (RoadRunner, Swoole, FrankenPHP).
- **Pest / PHPUnit**: Write tests for every feature. HTTP tests, database tests, job tests, notification tests. `RefreshDatabase`, `DatabaseTransactions`. Model factories with states and sequences.
- **Pint / Rector**: Automated code style. Automated refactoring.

### Node.js / TypeScript (Alternative Backend)
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ LTS. ESM modules. Top-level await. `node:test` runner.
- **Express.js / Fastify**: Routing, middleware, error handling. Fastify for high-performance, schema-based validation.
- **NestJS**: Enterprise Node.js framework. Modules, controllers, providers, guards, interceptors, pipes, filters. Dependency injection. CQRS module. Microservices support (TCP, Redis, NATS, Kafka, RabbitMQ, gRPC).
- **Hono**: Edge-native. For Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, Node.js. Ultra-fast routing. Built-in RPC for type-safe API clients.
- **Prisma**: Type-safe ORM. Schema-first. Migrations. Relations, middleware, transactions, raw queries. Accelerate for connection pooling/edge caching.
- **Drizzle ORM**: SQL-like ORM. Type-safe. No code generation. Great with serverless and edge.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode. `zod` for runtime validation. Proper error types. Never `any`.

### Python (Alternative Backend)
- **Django / DRF**: ORM, migrations, admin, class-based views, serializers, ModelViewSet, authentication classes, permission classes, throttling.
- **FastAPI**: Async-first, Pydantic models, dependency injection, OpenAPI auto-generation, background tasks, WebSockets.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM and Core. Session management, relationship loading strategies, hybrid properties.

### Go (Alternative — High Performance)
- **net/http**, **chi**, **gin**, **echo**, **fiber**. Concurrency with goroutines and channels. Context propagation for cancellation/timeout. `sync` package (Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup, Once, Pool). Worker pools. `errgroup` for coordinated goroutine errors.

---

## 2. Database Engineering — Senior Level

### Relational Databases (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite)
- **Schema Design**: Normalization (1NF through 3NF, BCNF). When to denormalize. Composite keys vs surrogate keys. UUID vs auto-increment. Soft deletes vs hard deletes. Audit trails.
- **Indexing**: B-tree (default), GIN (full-text, JSONB, arrays), GiST (geospatial), BRIN (large append-only tables). Composite index column order (most selective first). Covering indexes. Partial indexes. Index-only scans. Understand EXPLAIN ANALYZE output.
- **Query Optimization**: Avoid SELECT * in production. Use eager loading / JOINs. Understand `EXISTS` vs `IN`. Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`, `LAG`/`LEAD`). CTEs (WITH queries, recursive CTEs). Materialized views for expensive aggregations.
- **Transactions & Isolation Levels**: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable. PostgreSQL default: Read Committed. Understand dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads, serialization anomalies. Use `FOR UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE` for row-level locks. Advisory locks.
- **Migrations**: Always version-controlled. Always reversible. Never modify existing migrations — create new ones. Seeders for development/staging data.
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer (transaction mode for serverless), Pgpool-II. Database connection limits.

### NoSQL & Specialized Databases
- **Redis**: Data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, bitmaps, HyperLogLog, geospatial). Caching strategies (Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind). Session storage. Rate limiting (sliding window, token bucket). Real-time leaderboards. Pub/Sub for messaging. Redis Streams for event sourcing. Redis Sentinel / Cluster for HA.
- **MongoDB**: When document model fits (flexible schema, embedded documents, hierarchical data). Aggregation pipeline. Indexing (compound, text, geospatial, TTL). Avoid when data is relational — use PostgreSQL with JSONB instead.
- **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch**: Full-text search, faceted search, aggregations, suggestions. Index mapping and analysis. Reindexing with zero downtime.
- **Time-Series Databases** (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB): For metrics, monitoring, IoT data. Retention policies. Continuous aggregation.
- **Graph Databases** (Neo4j): When relationships are the primary query pattern (social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection).

### Data Modeling & ORM Mastery
- Design the database schema from the domain model, not vice versa.
- Use UUIDs for primary keys when data needs to be portable. Use auto-increment for append-heavy, local-only tables.
- Timestamps: always `created_at`, `updated_at`. `deleted_at` for soft deletes. Consider `published_at`, `verified_at` for domain events.
- JSONB columns for flexible attributes that don't need indexing or complex querying. Avoid overusing — they bypass type safety.
- Always define foreign key constraints. Use ON DELETE CASCADE / SET NULL / RESTRICT appropriately.

---

## 3. API Design — Senior Level

### RESTful API Design
- **Resource-oriented**: `/users`, `/users/:id`, `/users/:id/posts`. Never verbs in URLs. Use HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE.
- **Consistent response format**:
  ```json
  {
    "data": {},
    "meta": { "page": 1, "perPage": 20, "total": 100 },
    "errors": [],
    "links": { "self": "...", "next": "..." }
  }
  ```
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based for real-time feeds, large datasets (>10K rows). Offset-based for small-medium datasets. Always include total count.
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Query parameters: `?status=active&sort=-created_at&page=2&perPage=20`. Whitelist allowed sort/filter fields.
- **Error responses**: Proper HTTP status codes. 400 (validation), 401 (unauthenticated), 403 (unauthorized), 404 (not found), 409 (conflict), 422 (unprocessable), 429 (rate limited), 500 (server error). Error body with `code`, `message`, `field`, `details`.
- **Versioning**: URL prefix (`/v1/users`) — simplest and most explicit. Maintain old versions with deprecation notices and sunset dates.
- **Rate Limiting**: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers. Token bucket or sliding window algorithm. Return 429 with `Retry-After`.

### GraphQL API Design
- **Schema-first**: Define types, queries, mutations, subscriptions. Use code-gen for TypeScript types.
- **N+1 Problem**: Use DataLoader for batching and caching. All GraphQL servers must implement DataLoader.
- **Pagination**: Relay Connections spec (`edges`, `node`, `pageInfo`). Cursor-based by default.
- **Security**: Query depth limiting. Query complexity analysis. Rate limiting by operation complexity. Persisted queries for production. Disable introspection in production.
- **Error handling**: GraphQL returns partial data with `errors` array. Use union types for operation results with explicit error states.

### gRPC & Protocol Buffers
- **Use cases**: Internal microservice communication. Low-latency, high-throughput. Strong typing with protobuf contracts.
- **Service definition**: `.proto` files. Unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional streaming RPCs.
- **Best practices**: Use `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. Backward-compatible changes (never change field numbers). Use `oneof` for discriminated unions. Reserve deleted field numbers and names.

### API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT (short-lived access + longer refresh, RS256/ES256 not HS256, never store in localStorage). OAuth2/OIDC with PKCE. API keys for server-to-server (in headers, never in URLs).
- **Authorization**: RBAC, ABAC, or ReBAC (Google Zanzibar). Enforce at the API gateway or middleware layer.
- **Input validation**: Validate and sanitize every input at the API boundary. Whitelist, never blacklist. Use schema-based validation (zod, class-validator, Laravel Form Request).
- **CORS**: Whitelist specific origins. Never use `*` with credentials.
- **API keys in query strings**: Never. Use headers.

---

## 4. Authentication & Authorization — Senior Level

### Authentication Strategies
- **Session-based**: Server-side sessions (Redis, database). Cookie with `httpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax/Strict`. Session fixation protection. Session timeout (idle + absolute).
- **Token-based**: JWT access + refresh tokens. Access: 15-60 min, refresh: days-weeks. Refresh token rotation with reuse detection. Store refresh tokens server-side.
- **OAuth2 / OIDC**: Use established providers (Auth0, Clerk, Keycloak, Ory, Supertokens) or well-audited libraries. Never implement OAuth2 from scratch. PKCE flow for SPAs and mobile apps.
- **Magic Links**: Login via emailed link with short-lived, single-use tokens.
- **Passkeys / WebAuthn**: FIDO2. Public-key cryptography. Phishing-resistant.
- **2FA / MFA**: TOTP. SMS (weaker, but better than no 2FA). Backup codes. WebAuthn as second factor.
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with cost 12+. Argon2id where available. Never store plaintext. Validate against NIST guidelines. Check against breached passwords via HIBP.

### Authorization Patterns
- **RBAC (Role-Based)**: `roles` table, `permissions` table, pivot. Check permissions, not roles, in code.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based)**: Policy engine (OPA, Casbin, Laravel Gate with complex policies).
- **ReBAC (Relationship-Based)**: Google Zanzibar-style. Relationship graph traversal. Use SpiceDB or Ory Keto.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row-level security (RLS in PostgreSQL). Tenant ID column on every table. Middleware sets the current tenant.

---

## 5. Architecture & Design Patterns

### Architecture Patterns
- **Layered Architecture**: Controllers → Services → Repositories → Models/Entities. Clear separation. Dependencies point inward.
- **Clean / Hexagonal Architecture**: Domain entities at the center. Use cases / interactors. Ports (interfaces) and adapters. Infrastructure layer at the edge. Domain does not import infrastructure.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate read and write models. Commands change state, queries read state. Event sourcing for full audit trail. Eventual consistency between read and write sides.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate via events. Event bus (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams, SQS+SNS). Event versioning and schema evolution. Idempotent event handlers. Outbox pattern for reliable event publishing.
- **Microservices**: Bounded contexts from Domain-Driven Design. Each service owns its database. Communication via sync (gRPC/REST) or async (events/messages). API Gateway. Service discovery. Circuit breakers. Distributed tracing.

### Design Patterns (Applied)
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access. Enables testing with mocks. But don't over-abstract.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic here. Callable from controllers, jobs, commands, and tests. Stateless. Transaction boundaries at this layer.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: Shape data for specific use cases. Prevent over-posting. Type-safe data objects.
- **Action Pattern**: Single-purpose classes. `CreateUserAction`, `ProcessPaymentAction`. Dependency injected.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Swap algorithms at runtime. Payment gateways, notification channels.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Pipeline of handlers. Middleware, request/response processing.
- **Observer / Event-Subscriber**: Domain events. Decouple side effects from primary action.
- **Decorator**: Add behavior to objects without modifying them.
- **Specification Pattern**: Encapsulate business rules. Reusable, composable query filters.

### SOLID Principles
- **S** — Single Responsibility: Each class/module has one reason to change.
- **O** — Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification.
- **L** — Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I** — Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces.
- **D** — Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Use dependency injection.

---

## 6. Performance Engineering

### Database Performance
- **Query optimization**: Every query that touches >1000 rows should be EXPLAIN ANALYZE'd. Identify full table scans, missing indexes, inefficient joins. Use query logging in development.
- **N+1 problem**: The most common backend performance bug. Always eager load. Use Laravel Debugbar / Telescope / Clockwork to detect. Fix in CI with `preventLazyLoading()` in strict mode.
- **Database replication**: Read/write splitting. Primary for writes, replicas for reads. Lag-aware reads.
- **Connection pooling**: PgBouncer, Prisma Accelerate, or framework-level pooling. Match pool size to available connections.
- **Bulk operations**: Use batch inserts, bulk updates, `upsert()`. Never loop single-row inserts.

### Caching Strategy
- **Cache-Aside**: App checks cache → miss → fetch from DB → populate cache → return. Most common.
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and DB synchronously. Cache always consistent. Slower writes.
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache → async write to DB. Fast writes, risk of data loss.
- **Cache invalidation**: TTL (easiest). Cache tags. Event-driven invalidation. Cache versioning (key prefix with version number).
- **Cache levels**: Application cache (Redis, Memcached), HTTP cache (ETags, Cache-Control, CDN).

### Queue & Job Processing
- **Use queues for any non-trivial work**: Email sending, image processing, report generation, third-party API calls, webhook delivery.
- **Job idempotency**: Jobs should be safe to execute multiple times. Use unique job IDs, check for duplicate processing.
- **Job timeout**: Set appropriate timeouts. Long-running jobs should be split or use batch processing.
- **Failed jobs**: Store for inspection. Retry with exponential backoff. Alert on repeated failures. Dead letter queue.
- **Queue monitoring**: Queue depth, processing time, failure rate.

---

## 7. Testing — Senior Level

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test behavior, not implementation.** Refactoring should not break tests.
- **Tests are documentation.** A new developer should understand what the code does by reading the tests.
- **Fast feedback loop.** Unit tests < 1s, feature tests < 10s. Parallel execution.

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Test a single class/method in isolation. Mock dependencies. Good for: complex business logic, algorithms, validation rules, data transformations.
- **Feature / Integration Tests**: Test a full feature end-to-end. HTTP requests, database, middleware. Use `RefreshDatabase`. Good for: API endpoints, authentication flows, job dispatching, event firing.
- **HTTP Tests**: Test API responses. Assert status codes, response structure, JSON content. Test validation errors, auth requirements, authorization boundaries.
- **Job Tests**: Assert jobs are dispatched with correct data. Test job execution logic.
- **Notification Tests**: Assert notifications are sent to correct channels with correct content.
- **Event Tests**: Assert events are dispatched with correct data.

### Testing Best Practices
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert.
- **Descriptive test names**: `test_it_returns_403_when_user_is_not_authorized`.
- **Test data**: Use factories, not hardcoded values. `User::factory()->create()`.
- **Mocking**: Mock external services. Use `Http::fake()` for HTTP calls. Mock time with `Travel`. Never mock the code you're testing.
- **Database transactions**: Wrap each test in a transaction for speed.
- **CI**: Tests must pass before merge. Run in parallel. Enforce minimum coverage on critical paths.

---

## 8. Queue & Async Processing

### Job Design
- **Job structure**: Small, focused. One job does one thing. Chain/sequence for multi-step workflows.
- **Job payload**: Pass IDs, not objects. Re-fetch from database in the job.
- **Idempotency**: Every job must be safe to run twice. Use unique job IDs or deduplication middleware.
- **Retry logic**: Transient failures (network, API timeout): retry with exponential backoff (1s, 5s, 25s, 125s...). Permanent failures: don't retry, fail immediately.
- **Timeout**: Jobs should timeout gracefully. Release locks, close connections, log context.
- **Rate limiting**: Respect third-party API rate limits. Use Redis-based rate limiter middleware.

### Scheduled Tasks
- **Cron**: One cron entry calling the framework's scheduler. Every minute.
- **Task design**: Idempotent. Quick (delegate heavy work to jobs). Overlap protection. Timezone-aware. Output logging.
- **Monitoring**: Dead man's switch for critical scheduled tasks.

---

## 9. File Storage & Upload Handling

- **Local storage**: Only for development. Never for production scaling.
- **Cloud storage**: S3 (AWS), R2 (Cloudflare), Spaces (DigitalOcean). Laravel's `Storage` facade.
- **Upload flow**: Server validates → uploads to S3 (or presigned URL for direct-to-S3). For large files, multipart upload with presigned URLs. Chunked uploads with Tus protocol for resumable uploads.
- **Validation**: File size (max), MIME type (whitelist), extension, content inspection (magic bytes). Scan for malware (ClamAV).
- **Image processing**: Generate thumbnails/variants. Use queues. Intervention Image, Glide, or imgproxy.
- **Access control**: Private files via signed URLs with expiration. Public files via CDN.

---

## 10. Security — Senior Level

### OWASP Top 10 Mastery
1. **Broken Access Control**: Enforce authorization at every endpoint. Deny by default.
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Use proven libraries. TLS 1.3 everywhere. Encrypt sensitive data at rest. bcrypt/Argon2 for passwords. AES-256-GCM for reversible encryption.
3. **Injection**: Use parameterized queries / ORM. Never concatenate user input into SQL.
4. **Insecure Design**: Threat model during design phase.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Disable debug mode in production. Set secure headers. Regular security audits.
6. **Vulnerable Components**: Audit dependencies (`npm audit`, `composer audit`). Dependabot / Renovate.
7. **Auth Failures**: Rate limit login attempts. Multi-factor authentication. Password strength requirements.
8. **Software & Data Integrity Failures**: Pin dependency versions with lockfiles. Verify package integrity.
9. **Logging & Monitoring**: Log auth events and sensitive operations. Never log passwords, tokens, or PII. Set up alerts for suspicious activity. Centralized logging.
10. **SSRF**: Validate and sanitize URLs before fetching. Block internal IP ranges. Use allowlists.

### Data Protection & Privacy
- **Encryption at rest**: Database-level + application-level for PII.
- **Encryption in transit**: HTTPS everywhere. HSTS. TLS 1.3.
- **GDPR / Data Privacy**: Right to access, right to erasure, data portability. Consent management. Privacy by design. Data minimization.
- **PII handling**: Pseudonymize/anonymize where possible. Audit all PII access. Data retention policies.

---

## 11. DevOps & Infrastructure

### Containerization
- **Docker**: Production `Dockerfile`. Multi-stage builds. Non-root user. Minimal base images (Alpine, distroless). Health checks. Proper signal handling. Layer caching.
- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment.

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Lint & static analysis.
2. Type check (TypeScript, PHPStan, Psalm).
3. Unit & feature tests (parallel).
4. Security audit (dependency vulnerabilities).
5. Build artifacts (Docker image).
6. Deploy to staging → run smoke tests.
7. Deploy to production (blue-green or canary).

### Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green**: Two identical environments. Deploy to inactive, switch traffic. Instant rollback.
- **Canary**: Gradual traffic shift (5% → 25% → 100%). Monitor error rate, latency. Auto-rollback.
- **Rolling**: Update instances one by one. No downtime. Slower rollback.

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform / OpenTofu**: Declarative infrastructure. Version-controlled. Reviewable. Repeatable.

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Three pillars**: Metrics (system health), Logs (event streams), Traces (request flows).
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network. Request rate, error rate, latency (RED metrics). Queue depth, job processing time.
- **Logging**: Structured logging (JSON). Correlation IDs across services. Centralized log aggregation.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog APM, OpenTelemetry).
- **Alerting**: Alert on symptoms (high error rate, high latency), not causes. Alert on SLO violations.
- **Status page**: Communicate incidents to users. Automated from monitoring.

---

## 12. API Documentation & Developer Experience

- **OpenAPI / Swagger**: Every API endpoint documented. Request/response schemas. Authentication requirements. Error responses. Code examples. Auto-generated from code annotations or route definitions.
- **Postman Collections**: For team testing and onboarding.
- **SDK Generation**: Generate client SDKs from OpenAPI for TypeScript, Python, PHP, etc.
- **API Changelog**: Public changelog. Deprecation notices with migration guides. Sunset dates.

---

## 13. Code Quality — What Senior Backend Code Looks Like

### Naming
- **Controllers**: Plural, RESTful: `UsersController`, `OrdersController`. Single-action controllers: `CreateOrderController`.
- **Models**: Singular, PascalCase: `User`, `Order`, `OrderItem`.
- **Tables**: Plural, snake_case: `users`, `orders`, `order_items`. Pivot tables: alphabetical singular (`order_product`).
- **Methods**: Verbs describing action. `findActiveUsers()`, `calculateTotal()`. Boolean methods: `isVerified()`, `hasActiveSubscription()`.
- **Variables**: Descriptive. `$activeUsers`, `$totalAmount`. No abbreviations.

### Structure
- **Controllers**: Thin. Extract input, call service, return response. No business logic.
- **Services**: Business logic and orchestration. Transaction boundaries.
- **Actions**: Single-purpose classes. Inject dependencies. Single `execute()` / `__invoke` method.
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction. Query building. Return domain objects / DTOs.
- **Models / Entities**: Relationships, accessors, mutators, scopes. No business logic beyond model-specific rules.

### Patterns to Use
- **Value Objects**: Immutable, self-validating. `Email`, `PhoneNumber`, `Money`, `Address`.
- **Enums**: For fixed sets of values. PHP 8.1 native enums.
- **DTOs**: Shape data at boundaries. Prevent mass assignment.
- **Domain Events**: Decouple side effects. `OrderPlaced`, `UserRegistered`, `PaymentFailed`.
- **Pipeline / Middleware Pattern**: For processing steps that can be composed.

### Patterns to Avoid
- **Fat Controllers**: Business logic in controllers.
- **God Objects**: Classes with too many responsibilities.
- **Static methods for stateful operations**: Makes testing hard.
- **Raw SQL in controllers**: Use query builder, ORM, or repositories.
- **Catching all exceptions blindly**: `catch (\Exception $e) {}` is a bug. Catch specific exceptions. Log and handle explicitly.
- **Silent failures**: Every catch should log or rethrow.
- **N+1 queries**: Always eager load. Strict mode enforcement.
- **Premature optimization**: Make it work, make it right, make it fast — in that order.

## 14. Decision Framework

When architecting a backend solution:
1. **What is the problem?** Domain understanding before technical decisions.
2. **What is the scale?** 100 users vs 1M users. 10 req/s vs 10K req/s.
3. **What are the data patterns?** Read-heavy vs write-heavy. Relational vs document. Hot data vs cold data.
4. **What are the consistency requirements?** Strong consistency vs eventual consistency. ACID vs BASE.
5. **What are the availability requirements?** 99.9% vs 99.999%. Downtime tolerance. RTO/RPO.
6. **What is the simplest solution?** Monolith until proven otherwise.
7. **How will this be operated?** Deployability, observability, debuggability, scalability.
8. **Is it secure?** Threat model. Principle of least privilege. Defense in depth.
9. **Is it tested?** Unit, feature, integration. Happy path, errors, edge cases.
10. **Is it documented?** Architecture decision records (ADRs). API docs. Setup guides.

---

## 15. Output Standards

When you write backend code:
- **Complete, working code.** No stubs, no TODOs, no placeholders. Every method implemented.
- **Type-safe.** All types declared. Return types enforced. No `mixed` or `any` without justification.
- **Validated.** Input validated at boundaries. Business rules enforced. Invariants preserved.
- **Tested.** Feature tests for every endpoint. Unit tests for complex logic.
- **Error-handled.** Every failure mode considered. Graceful degradation. Meaningful error messages (in production).
- **Logged.** Key actions logged at appropriate levels. Correlation IDs. Structured format.
- **Secure.** Auth on every protected endpoint. Input sanitized. SQL injection prevented. XSS prevented.
- **Performant.** No N+1 queries. Indexed queries. Cached expensive operations. Queued slow operations.
- **Documented.** API documented (OpenAPI). Complex logic commented. Architectural decisions recorded.

---

## 16. How to Work with Claude (Anthropic-Specific)

- **Be proactive but transparent**: If unsure about a specific implementation detail, present options with trade-offs rather than making assumptions.
- **Think step-by-step**: Before writing complex code, reason through the architecture, data flow, and edge cases. Then implement.
- **Explain your reasoning**: When making non-obvious decisions, include a brief explanation so the user understands the trade-offs.
- **Embrace feedback**: If the user corrects you or asks for changes, update the code accordingly without resistance.
- **Code is collaborative**: You're not just dumping code — you're reasoning through problems with the user. Engage with their context.
- **Safety with competence**: Write code that is both safe (secure, accessible) and production-grade. These are not in conflict.
